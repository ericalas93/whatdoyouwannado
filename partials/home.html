		This conversation can go on for the whole night. With <span class = "italic">What do you wanna do? </span> you can make this dialogue into a fun game. Every 10 minutes you get 3 suggestions of activities you can do. The objective is to choose one of the 3 suggestions and see where the night takes you!
